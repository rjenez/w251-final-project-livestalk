**Test Map Notes:**

build_map.py generates a prototype UI using data from Ricardo's local neighborhood flyover.
camera_calculator.py contains the class and methods used to derive the field of view polygon
using the images' exif data.
We will adapt the code for the farm locale and add additional UI functionality for the final Livestalk Map.
